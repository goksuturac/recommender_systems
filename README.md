# RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS with [scikit-surprise](https://surpriselib.com/)


This project aims to develop a recommender system that provides personalized movie suggestions by analyzing users' film preferences using the Surprise library, which is part of the scikit-learn ecosystem. The project enhances user experience by recommending films based on what users have previously watched and the ratings they have given. Initially, a dataset is created using interaction data between users and movies, including user IDs, movie IDs, and ratings. Subsequently, this dataset is trained using a matrix factorization method such as SVD (Singular Value Decomposition). The model predicts movies that each user is likely to enjoy and ranks the films based on the predicted ratings, offering tailored recommendations. The project aims to increase user satisfaction by delivering effective suggestions based on the movies users have already watched. Throughout this process, metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) are employed to evaluate the accuracy of the model. The Surprise library facilitates the rapid prototyping of the recommendation system and the comparison of various algorithms, simplifying the development process.
